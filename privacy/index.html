      <h1>Privacy Policy for Nectarsac</h1>
      <h3>This website is currently only built to be a way for Ian Washburne (ianw11@gmail.com) and his friends to play games, share hearthstone replays, and generally mess around.  It's also Ian's tinkering grounds to understand how web servers work.</h3>

      <h4>For Google/YouTube: same stuff applies.  I just want to create a dragnet for my discord that saves youtube videos to a playlist.</h2>

      <p>Legal-ese is one of my least favorite things so simply put I'm not taking any private data and I promise if something stumbles my way I won't resell it or do anything devious with it.  More likely I'll delete it and notify whoever is giving me their credit card number or whatever that I don't want it.  Facebook: is this good enough?  My friends just want a way to save links from Messenger so we can read them later without scrolling up and this is a pretty painful process.</p>
