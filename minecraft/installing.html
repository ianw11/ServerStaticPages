<h1>Hello, you found the Installation page!</h1>

<div class="wrap">
<div class="container">
<p>Hello friends, here I'll tell you how you can install a modded version of Minecraft in a few steps.
</p>
<p> First, you'll want to make sure you have <a href="https://updates.curseapp.net/windows/CurseClientSetup.exe">Curse Voice</a> installed.
<br>Then, make sure the Minecraft plugin is enabled in settings (may be enabled by default).</p>
<p>A very key step in modded Minecraft is to increase the memory allocation in the Curse Voice settings. 
Increase it to about 6GB or 6144MB in the Minecraft tab of the settings. </p>

<p>To also help with memory issues, you'll be later installing a mod called <a href="http://asie.pl/foamfix/foamfix-0.5.1-anarchy.jar">foamfix</a>. This reduces memory used by some mods by reducing the number of textures loaded into the game. It doesn't have an impact on your performance at all (and might actually make it run faster).</p>

<p>When you click on the Minecraft tab in Curse Voice, you'll see a few options at the top "Browse All Modpacks",
"Browse FTB Modpacks" and "Create Custom Profile". For this first verision of the page, I'll just have you click 
on the "Browse FTB Modpacks" button, and select "FTB Presents Direwolf20 1.10". Click on the "Install" button and
wait a few minutes while it installs.</p>

<p>Once the install finishes, click on the icon of the modpack in the main Minecraft tab. You'll see a list of 
mods, and a couple of tabs: "Overview", "Installed Mods", "Resource Packs", and "Maps". In the top right, there
will be a button "...". Click on it and then click on "Profile Options". Within this menu, make sure that the Memory
Settings show the right amount of allocated memory (about 6GB).</p>

<p>This next step takes a little bit of time, but you'll have to press the play button, log into your Minecraft
account in the launcher, and wait a few minutes for the game to load completely. Now, you actually have to
close the game, as this initial launch was just to generate the folders that you'll be adding a mod to.
At this point, you'll want to click on that "..." button again and open the folder in Windows Explorer. In the mods
folder, add the foamfix anarchy version you downloaded earlier. It should show up as a .jar file in this folder.</p>

<p>Now you can start the game again and this time for good! Once the game finishes loading, click on multiplayer
and add the server that you've been given the information for.</p>
<br>
<div class="end">
<p> That should be all! </p>
